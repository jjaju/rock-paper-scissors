# rock-paper-scissors

Inspired by Peter Ganunis' epic Rock-Paper-Scissors battles on [TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFceGdAh/), we tried to bring the action to your browser.

This project was created with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and built mostly in one day - so expect the unexpected.

We hope you have fun! :rock: :scroll: :scissors:
